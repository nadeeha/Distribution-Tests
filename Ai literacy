Great! Here's a comparison table you can directly use in your slide to illustrate the MLOps maturity levels (Level 0 to Level 2), based on Google's framework:

Slide Title: MLOps Maturity Levels (Google Cloud Framework)

Aspect	Level 0: Manual	Level 1: Pipeline Automation	Level 2: Full CI/CD Automation

Process	Manual & ad hoc	Partially automated via pipelines	Fully automated with CI/CD and triggers
Reproducibility	Low	Medium – Experiments reproducible	High – Entire lifecycle reproducible
Model Training	Manual (scripts, notebooks)	Automated pipelines (e.g., Vertex Pipelines)	Continuous training (triggered by new data)
Deployment	Manual (copy/paste, UI upload)	Automated (pipeline deploy to test/staging)	CI/CD to production with approval steps
Versioning	Not enforced	Code & model versioning	Code, data, model versioning fully integrated
Monitoring	Absent	Limited (manual checks)	Full monitoring + drift detection + alerting
Testing	None	Basic (e.g., metrics logging)	Automated unit, integration, model performance
Team Scalability	1–2 people	Project team	Multiple models, cross-functional teams
Use Case Suitability	Research, PoC	MVPs, internal tools	Business-critical production systems
