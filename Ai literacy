Thanks, Nadeeha — that helps! Based on your stakeholders (Data Science, IT, Business Owners, IQ Lab, Innovation & Ventures), I’ll build a RACI matrix grouped by focus area (e.g., Data, Modeling, Deployment, Reporting, etc.) and then list specific service tasks within each focus.

📘 RACI Matrix – Pilot & Production (Structured by Focus Area)

Focus Area	Service Task	Data Science	IT	Business Owners	IQ Lab	Innovation & Ventures

1. Data Enablement	Ingest and clean FactSet data into BQ	C	R/A	I	I	I
	Maintain entity & ISIN mapping	R	C	I	I	I
	Enable versioning and delta loads	C	R	I	I	I
2. Theme Classification Engine	Build L6 → Theme mapping logic using GenAI + rules	R/A	C	C	C	C
	Validate edge cases with GPT or domain input	R		C	A	C
	Finalize inclusion/exclusion rules per theme	R		A	C	C
3. Model Portfolio Construction	Apply rules to create portfolios (MA & PB use cases)	R/A	C	C	C	I
	Define backtesting or performance metrics	R		A	C	C
4. Automation & Deployment	Set up Airflow/Composer jobs for pipeline	C	R/A	I	I	I
	Build modular config-driven scripts	R	C	I	I	I
	Ensure compliance logging (GenAI use, overrides)	R	C	I	A	I
5. Reporting & Consumption	Export portfolio outputs to dashboards (Power BI, etc.)	R	C	I	I	I
	Create downloadable outputs (Excel/PDF)	R	C	I		
	Build SDG-aligned theme overlays	R	C	C	I	A
6. Governance & Oversight	Ensure explainability of model outputs	R		A	C	C
	Conduct regular stakeholder reviews	A	I	R	C	C

📌 Legend

R: Responsible — does the work

A: Accountable — owns the outcome

C: Consulted — provides input

I: Informed — kept in the loop

📎 How to Present in Confluence

1. Create collapsible sections per focus area


2. Use tables like above within each section


3. Add stakeholder personas (e.g., “IT = Cloud Engineering team”) for clarity



Would you like a downloadable version (Excel, PNG table, or Lucidchart) or a visual matrix showing it as a grid with stakeholders on columns and tasks as rows?
