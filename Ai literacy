Slide Title: Problem Statement – Why MLOps Matters for Us


---

🧩 The Challenge

Despite advances in Data Science & ML capabilities across our team…

Only 10–20% of ML projects globally make it to production (Gartner, 2023).

Many models remain trapped in experimentation—never scaled or deployed.

Common blockers: lack of MLOps foundations—versioning, deployment, monitoring, CI/CD.

🔍 Reality Within Our Team

While we've built numerous ML use cases, only a few are truly operationalized or part of production workflows.

Reuse, reproducibility, and collaborative development are limited.

There's a gap between experimentation and real-world deployment.

🧱 Our Group’s Mission

> Although we’re called the “Enhancing MLOps Practices” working group,
in practice, our core focus has been on establishing foundational MLOps capabilities first.
