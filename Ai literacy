Absolutely! Here's a practical MLOps classification checklist that your team can use to assess any ML use case and determine whether it belongs to Level 0, Level 1, or Level 2 — based on Google’s MLOps maturity model.

🔍 Step-by-Step Evaluation Checklist

Area	Checklist Item	✅ Yes / ❌ No

Code & Repo	Code is stored in version control (Git)	
	Project follows modular folder structure (e.g., training/, eval/, pipelines/)	
Data Management	Data schema is validated and versioned	
	Feature engineering code is reusable and/or integrated with Feature Store	
Training	Training is automated via scripts or pipelines	
	Supports AutoML or custom training via containers	
Model Evaluation	Evaluation metrics (AUC, ROC, etc.) are logged and versioned	
	Evaluation is automated and tracked	
Deployment	Model is deployed to a managed endpoint (online or batch)	
	Deployment is versioned and staged (test → prod)	
Pipelines	Vertex AI Pipelines or equivalent used to orchestrate train → deploy → monitor	
Monitoring	Drift detection and alerting configured	
	Model performance is logged over time	
CI/CD Integration	CI/CD pipeline exists for code or model deployment	
	Pipeline can be triggered via Git or new data	
Continuous Training	Pipeline supports retraining on schedule or trigger	
Approval Workflow	Human-in-the-loop or approval gates before deploying to production

🎯 How to Classify Based on the Checklist

Total "Yes"	Classification	Meaning

0–4	Level 0 – Manual	Mostly exploratory / ad hoc
5–9	Level 1 – Automated Pipelines	Has reproducible components, but lacks CI/CD & CT
10–14	Level 2 – Full MLOps	Ready for production with CI/CD, monitoring, CT

📌 Usage Tip

> Use this checklist at the start and end of a project to benchmark MLOps maturity and guide your team on next steps.

🧠 Best Practices Summary (Bullet Points)

Keep code modular and versioned in Git

Use CI/CD pipelines for testing and deployment

Structure GCS with timestamped folders for traceability

Avoid storing raw code in GCS — only outputs and specs

Use environment-based separation: mlops-staging-bucket/, mlops-prod-bucket/
