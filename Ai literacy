📆 Rolling Role Assignment Approach

🌀 Roles of Champion and Guardian will rotate every quarter or sprint, based on availability, contribution, or project phase

Each member will:

Take turns leading as Champion (strategic enabler)

Support in a Guardian capacity (technical QA / enforcer)


This ensures:

Broader ownership

Increased skill transfer

Balanced innovation vs standardization




---

✅ Next Steps

Nominate initial members for Champion & Guardian roles

Draft key responsibilities and decision rights

Resolve overlaps via clear boundaries or co-leads
