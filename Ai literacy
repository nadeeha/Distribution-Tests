Great! Now that you’ve locked in the visual, here’s a clear, well-worded explanation for each term (AI, ML, Deep Learning, GenAI), each paired with a finance-specific use case that’s simple, relatable, and non-technical — ideal for your mixed audience at HSBC Asset Management.


---

1. Artificial Intelligence (AI)

> Definition: AI is the broad field of creating systems that mimic human intelligence to perform tasks like reasoning, learning, and decision-making.



> Use Case:
Automated fraud detection using business rules
Example: If a transaction exceeds $10,000 and originates from a flagged country, the system triggers a hold and escalates to compliance.
This is traditional, rule-based AI — no learning involved, just logic programmed by humans.




---

2. Machine Learning (ML)

> Definition: ML is a subset of AI that learns patterns from historical data to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.



> Use Case:
Predicting client churn
Example: A model learns from past client behavior — AUM drop, fewer logins, support requests — and predicts which clients are at risk of leaving.
The system learns from patterns, and improves as it gets more data.




---

3. Deep Learning (DL)

> Definition: DL is a more advanced form of ML that uses neural networks to find complex patterns in large or unstructured data (like text, images, or audio).



> Use Case:
Detecting insider risk from emails or chat logs
Example: A neural network analyzes employee communications to identify subtle language patterns that suggest misconduct or policy violations.
These patterns are too complex for humans or simple models to catch — deep learning finds them.




---

4. Generative AI (GenAI)

> Definition: GenAI is a type of deep learning that doesn’t just predict — it creates. It generates new content like text, summaries, code, or even images based on its training.



> Use Case:
Auto-generating quarterly fund commentaries
Example: An LLM reads through fund performance data, market events, and internal notes, then drafts a complete commentary in seconds.
Analysts then review and customize it, saving hours of work while maintaining compliance.

Closing Line for This Slide (Optional):

> “These technologies build on each other — from simple logic to pattern recognition to full-scale content creation. In finance, they help us move faster, be more precise, and focus on judgment, not just processing.”

Would you like this formatted as a speaker notes version, or included in a formatted table/slide for pasting into your deck?


Great idea — this Zoom poll will help reinforce your Slide 3 (AI vs ML vs DL vs GenAI) in a fun, engaging way. Here's a multiple-question Zoom poll you can launch after the explanation slide to test understanding of which use case fits which AI type.

Perfect — clarity is key, especially for a mixed audience. Below is a refined set of Zoom poll questions where only one option is clearly correct based on the question wording. Each use case is designed to eliminate ambiguity by being specific in context, input type, and output type.


---

Poll Title:

“Which Type of AI Is at Work?”


---

Q1. A system blocks a transaction every time it’s over $10,000 and sent to a flagged country — with no learning or adaptation.

What type of AI is being used?

A) Machine Learning

B) Deep Learning

C) Generative AI

D) Rule-based AI
Correct Answer: D) Rule-based AI
(Because it uses fixed rules, not data-driven learning)



---

Q2. A model is trained on structured transaction data (amount, frequency, country) to predict the probability of future fraud.

What type of AI is powering this?

A) Rule-based AI

B) Machine Learning

C) Generative AI

D) Deep Learning
Correct Answer: B) Machine Learning
(Because it uses structured tabular data to learn patterns)



---

Q3. A neural network model analyzes unstructured voice call transcripts to detect potential regulatory violations in language tone.

Which AI technique is used?

A) Rule-based AI

B) Machine Learning

C) Generative AI

D) Deep Learning
Correct Answer: D) Deep Learning
(Because it handles unstructured text with complex patterns)



---

Q4. A chatbot creates original summaries of lengthy investment reports when asked a question like “What were the main Q4 risks?”

What is powering this?

A) Machine Learning

B) Deep Learning

C) Generative AI

D) Rule-based AI
Correct Answer: C) Generative AI
(Because it's producing natural language output from context)



---

Q5. A model trained on thousands of historical earnings calls learns how to write a fund commentary in HSBC's style.

Which AI type is best suited for this?

A) Traditional ML

B) Rule-based AI

C) Generative AI

D) Deep Learning
Correct Answer: C) Generative AI
(Because it's trained to generate textual content, not just predict or classify)
