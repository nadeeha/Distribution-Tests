Great! Now that you’ve locked in the visual, here’s a clear, well-worded explanation for each term (AI, ML, Deep Learning, GenAI), each paired with a finance-specific use case that’s simple, relatable, and non-technical — ideal for your mixed audience at HSBC Asset Management.


---

1. Artificial Intelligence (AI)

> Definition: AI is the broad field of creating systems that mimic human intelligence to perform tasks like reasoning, learning, and decision-making.



> Use Case:
Automated fraud detection using business rules
Example: If a transaction exceeds $10,000 and originates from a flagged country, the system triggers a hold and escalates to compliance.
This is traditional, rule-based AI — no learning involved, just logic programmed by humans.




---

2. Machine Learning (ML)

> Definition: ML is a subset of AI that learns patterns from historical data to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.



> Use Case:
Predicting client churn
Example: A model learns from past client behavior — AUM drop, fewer logins, support requests — and predicts which clients are at risk of leaving.
The system learns from patterns, and improves as it gets more data.




---

3. Deep Learning (DL)

> Definition: DL is a more advanced form of ML that uses neural networks to find complex patterns in large or unstructured data (like text, images, or audio).



> Use Case:
Detecting insider risk from emails or chat logs
Example: A neural network analyzes employee communications to identify subtle language patterns that suggest misconduct or policy violations.
These patterns are too complex for humans or simple models to catch — deep learning finds them.




---

4. Generative AI (GenAI)

> Definition: GenAI is a type of deep learning that doesn’t just predict — it creates. It generates new content like text, summaries, code, or even images based on its training.



> Use Case:
Auto-generating quarterly fund commentaries
Example: An LLM reads through fund performance data, market events, and internal notes, then drafts a complete commentary in seconds.
Analysts then review and customize it, saving hours of work while maintaining compliance.

Closing Line for This Slide (Optional):

> “These technologies build on each other — from simple logic to pattern recognition to full-scale content creation. In finance, they help us move faster, be more precise, and focus on judgment, not just processing.”

Would you like this formatted as a speaker notes version, or included in a formatted table/slide for pasting into your deck?


Great idea — this Zoom poll will help reinforce your Slide 3 (AI vs ML vs DL vs GenAI) in a fun, engaging way. Here's a multiple-question Zoom poll you can launch after the explanation slide to test understanding of which use case fits which AI type.
