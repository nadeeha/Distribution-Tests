Great â€” this is the perfect time to wrap up your presentation with a forward-looking slide that compares MLOps and LLMOps, and sets the stage for future GenAI/LLM projects in your team.

âœ… Slide Title: MLOps vs. LLMOps â€“ Expanding Our Operational Scope


---

ðŸ¤– What is LLMOps?

> LLMOps (Large Language Model Operations) is the evolution of MLOps â€” focused on the unique needs of deploying, managing, and scaling Generative AI / LLM-based systems.

ðŸ“Š MLOps vs. LLMOps â€“ Side-by-Side Comparison

Dimension	MLOps	LLMOps

Model Type	Traditional ML (e.g., classifiers, regressors, tabular)	Pre-trained LLMs (e.g., Gemini, GPT-4, Claude, LLaMA)
Training	Train from scratch or fine-tune on structured datasets	Mostly use foundation models; fine-tune or prompt engineer
Inference	Predictive, lightweight, fast	Text generation, long-context, heavier compute
Pipeline Orchestration	Vertex Pipelines, Kubeflow, Airflow	Similar tools, but may include prompt chains or RAG flows
Versioning	Model versions + artifacts	Prompt versioning, model fallback logic, embedding store tracking
Monitoring	Track accuracy, drift, latency	Monitor hallucinations, toxicity, cost (tokens), feedback quality
CI/CD	For code, model, pipeline deployment	Add prompt testing, approval steps for prompt/model updates
Security & Compliance	Standard model governance	Special guardrails (e.g., PII, hallucination filters, approval workflows)
Use Cases	Churn prediction, fraud detection, recommendation systems	Chatbots, summarization, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), Q&A

ðŸ§© Takeaway for Our Team

> As we establish strong MLOps foundations, weâ€™re now positioned to extend those practices into LLMOps â€” enabling our team to confidently develop and deploy GenAI-powered systems with the same rigor and scalability.




---

ðŸŽ¯ Future Direction

Pilot an LLMOps use case (e.g., WatchMatch NLP/LLM system, internal chatbot, summarizer)

Define best practices for:

Prompt management & versioning

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipelines

Embedding store tracking & feedback loops


Leverage Vertex AIâ€™s new GenAI capabilities: model garden, prompt tuning, output guardrails
