Speaker Notes for Slide 1 – “AI Literacy”

> "Hi everyone! Thanks so much for joining this Lunch & Learn. I know your calendars are full, and I really appreciate you making time for this session.



> Today, we're diving into something that’s already reshaping our work, whether we realize it or not — Artificial Intelligence. This isn’t just about ChatGPT or automation buzzwords — it’s about how AI is becoming a true partner in decision-making, analysis, and even creativity.



> This session is for all of us — whether you’re already using AI in your day-to-day or still unsure what all the hype is about. My goal is to demystify AI in a way that’s real, relevant, and tailored for us in finance.



> So let’s make this interactive, keep it informal, and hopefully, you’ll walk out with a few practical takeaways — and maybe even a bit of excitement for what’s possible."

Speaker Notes for Slide 2 – Agenda

> “So here’s a quick look at what we’re going to cover today.



> We’ll start with why AI matters — not just in the tech world, but specifically in our world of finance and asset management.



> Then, we’ll demystify some of the most common buzzwords — AI, ML, Deep Learning, Generative AI — not just what they mean, but when they matter and how they connect.



> From there, we’ll shift into something a lot more hands-on: prompt engineering. It sounds technical, but it’s really just about learning how to talk to AI — and get the best out of it.



> I’ll walk you through some simple techniques that anyone can use — whether you're drafting reports, analyzing data, or exploring new investment ideas.



> Finally, we’ll wrap up with learning pathways and resources — where to go next if you want to keep building your AI fluency.



> My goal today isn’t to turn anyone into an AI expert — it’s to help you feel more confident, curious, and maybe even a little excited about how AI can support what you already do best.”

Speaker Notes for Slide 3 – Zoom Poll: “Your AI Exposure”

> “Before we dive in, I’d love to get a sense of where everyone is coming from — because the beauty of this topic is that we’re all at different points on the journey.



> This poll is anonymous, so feel free to answer honestly.



> Whether you’re playing around with ChatGPT at home, using tools like Lydia or Alfred at work, or you’ve never touched any of this — it’s all valid.



> We’ve designed today’s session to meet you wherever you are — so whether you’re hands-on with AI tools or still just AI-curious, you’ll hopefully walk away with something useful.”



> (After a few seconds)
“Okay, let’s see where we land as a group… I love this because it reminds us that we’re not alone in figuring all this out — and that AI isn’t just for data scientists or tech teams anymore.”


Speaker Notes for Slide 4 – The State of AI in 2025

> “We’ve now reached a point where AI is no longer optional — it’s operational. According to McKinsey, over 70% of global enterprises are using AI in production today, compared to just 50% two years ago. That’s a huge shift — and it shows that AI has moved from hype to business-critical.”



> “What’s really driving this momentum is Generative AI — tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, and BloombergGPT — which are now integrated into everyday workflows: emails, spreadsheets, coding tools, research platforms. They're helping us generate content, uncover insights, and automate repetitive work.”



> “And right here in finance and asset management, we’re not behind — we’re leading. BCG and Deloitte report that our sector is already applying GenAI in earnings summarization, ESG signal extraction, and even writing portfolio commentaries.”



> “Of course, with that growth comes responsibility. Regulators are now catching up — 2025 is seeing an acceleration of AI governance efforts like the EU AI Act, SEC disclosures, and MAS guidelines. Compliance, transparency, and explainability are no longer optional in AI either.”



> “Interestingly, this shift isn’t just about tech teams. We’re seeing an AI-native mindset becoming the norm — analysts and PMs are using AI copilots for analysis, writing, and communication. It's part of how work gets done now.”



> “And at HSBC, we're not just consuming GenAI — we're building it. From Lydia to ESG-specific copilots, our internal AI tools are being tailored for our own use cases — from sales to reporting to risk.”

“And just to give you a sense of how fast things are moving — these are all headlines from just the last few weeks.”



> “Google’s AI Mode is literally changing how we interact with search. We’re not just getting links anymore — we’re getting AI summaries directly. That changes research workflows overnight.”



> “Meanwhile, Microsoft is embedding AI agents directly into its ecosystem — imagine Excel explaining trends in plain English or Outlook writing client updates for you.”



> “And closer to home, the finance sector — especially in the UK — is leading global AI adoption. Asset managers are building their own copilots, experimenting with GenAI in reporting, client engagement, and ESG disclosures.”

“Let’s unpack some of the most used — and often confused — terms when we talk about AI. You’ll hear them used interchangeably, but they each represent a different layer of capability.”




---

🔹 Artificial Intelligence (AI)

> “This is the umbrella term. AI refers to any system that can perform tasks that would typically require human intelligence — things like reasoning, learning, pattern recognition, or decision-making.”



> “In finance, that could be a basic rules-based fraud system — for example, flagging a transaction if it’s over $10,000 and from a flagged country. It’s not learning from data — it's just following logic we’ve hardcoded. But that’s still AI.”




---

🔹 Machine Learning (ML)

> “Now, within AI, we have Machine Learning — this is when we move from programming logic to letting the system learn from data.”



> “Think of it like this: instead of saying ‘If X happens, do Y,’ we feed the model data about what’s happened in the past, and it figures out patterns. In asset management, one classic use case is predicting client churn. The model looks at past behavior — like AUM drops, fewer logins, and service requests — and learns what patterns typically lead to a client leaving.”



> “It doesn’t need rules. It learns the risk indicators from the data itself.”




---

🔹 Deep Learning (DL)

> “Deep Learning is a more advanced form of ML. It uses what’s called neural networks, which are designed to mimic how the human brain processes information — but don’t worry, you don’t need to know the math.”



> “Where ML works well with structured data like spreadsheets, deep learning is great for unstructured data — like emails, documents, audio, even images.”



> “A finance use case here could be detecting insider risk. A deep learning model could analyze large volumes of internal emails and pick up subtle language patterns — like tone, urgency, sentiment — that might indicate misconduct.”




---

🔹 Generative AI (GenAI)

> “And finally, we come to the one that’s dominating headlines — Generative AI.”



> “Unlike traditional ML or DL models that classify or predict, GenAI creates. It generates completely new content — text, code, images — based on what it’s learned during training.”



> “In our world, this might look like:



Auto-generating fund commentaries from raw performance data

Summarizing ESG reports

Drafting client-facing insights based on internal research notes.”


> “You feed it context — and it produces high-quality drafts in seconds. That’s the power of GenAI.”




---

🧠 How to Remember the Difference

> “So the progression looks like this:

Speaker Notes – Slide 6: Zoom Poll (Use Case Classification)

> “Let’s pause here for a quick poll. I want to see how confidently we can connect AI buzzwords to actual use cases — especially the kinds we deal with in finance and asset management.”



> “On the left, you’ll see a chatbot summarizing lengthy investment reports when asked something like, ‘What were the main Q4 risks?’ That’s a real-world scenario some of us are already starting to see.”



> “And on the right, we’ve got another common use case: a system that automatically classifies transactions as fraudulent or not, based on past labeled data.”



> “So for each case, choose the most accurate AI category you think powers it.”



> [Pause for responses]




---

✅ Answer Key (for post-poll discussion)

Left side:

> Correct Answer: C) Generative AI
Because the chatbot is not just retrieving or classifying — it’s creating original summaries based on context and natural language queries. This is the hallmark of GenAI.



Right side:

> Correct Answer: B) Machine Learning
This system is learning from historical labeled data (fraudulent vs. not), and predicting based on that — which is exactly what ML is designed to do.




---

🧠 Wrap-up Talking Point:

> “These examples highlight why it's important to understand how different types of AI show up in our workflows. GenAI gets the spotlight, but traditional ML is doing a lot of the heavy lifting behind the scenes — especially in compliance, fraud, and portfolio modeling.”

Speaker Notes – Slide 7 (with Animation Reveal)

> “Let’s talk about prompts — arguably the most powerful skill you can build right now for working with AI.”



> “A prompt is how you talk to a language model. It’s your instruction, your question, or your context. But just like with a junior analyst — vague requests lead to vague results.”



> “Take these examples on the left.
‘Write a fund commentary.’
‘Summarize this PDF.’
‘Explain portfolio performance.’
They’re simple, but also a bit too open-ended. There’s no timeframe, no focus, no clarity.”



> [Now click to reveal the right-hand side]



> “Now compare those to this.”



> “Instead of just ‘write a fund commentary’, we say:
‘Write a Q1 2024 fund commentary for a UK equity fund, focusing on sector rotation.’
That gives the AI clear context, a defined scope, and a focus area.”



> “We’ve essentially turned a vague request into a strong brief — the kind that actually saves time rather than creating more edits later.”



> “If you’re writing prompts — or even asking AI follow-up questions — keep this checklist in mind: ✔️ Be clear
✔️ Provide context
✔️ Define the output format
✔️ Choose a role or tone
✔️ Add constraints or detail”



> “That’s how you go from generic AI output to high-quality, finance-relevant results — fast.”




---

Speaker Notes – Slide 8: Prompt Engineering Techniques (Detailed Version)

> “So now that we’ve seen what makes a good prompt versus a vague one, let’s go one step further and look at two powerful prompt engineering techniques you can apply — both designed to help you get much more accurate, structured, and relevant outputs from GenAI tools.”




---

🔶 Technique 1: Role + Task + Context + Format

> “This technique is great when you want GenAI to generate something for you — like a fund commentary, a summary, or a write-up. Think of it like briefing an intern or a junior analyst.”



> “You start by assigning a role — this sets the tone. For example: ‘You are a fund manager.’ That already tells the AI how it should ‘think’ and write.”



> “Then you give a task — what exactly do you want it to do? In this case: ‘Summarize the Q2 2025 performance of our multi-asset income fund.’”



> “Now, add context — so it knows what matters: ‘Global equities underperformed, fixed income provided downside protection, USD strength impacted EM exposure.’ This helps avoid generic answers.”



> “And finally, you specify the output format: ‘3 bullet points followed by a 1-paragraph summary in a professional tone.’ This ensures the result is structured, concise, and usable — not a blob of AI ramble.”




---

✅ Why this works:

Role sets tone and voice (PM vs. analyst vs. client rep)

Task focuses the model on exactly what you need

Context ensures it's relevant to your data or situation

Format gives you control over how it’s delivered (which matters a lot when you copy-paste into reports or client materials)


> “I often say: if you wouldn’t brief a colleague by saying ‘Write a commentary’, don’t brief an AI model that way either.”




---

🔷 Technique 2: Step-by-Step Decomposition (Chain-of-Thought Prompting)

> “Now this second technique is more about analysis than generation — it’s for when you want the AI to reason through something in stages, rather than guessing at a complete answer.”



> “Let’s say you’re asking: ‘Why did our equity fund underperform in Q3?’ That’s a tricky one, even for a human.”



> “So instead of just asking the AI for a direct answer, you break it down like this:



First, identify macroeconomic drivers

Then, analyze sector-level allocation differences

Then, summarize how these contributed to underperformance

Finally, give a short concluding summary”



---

✅ Why this works:

It encourages structured thinking, like a checklist

It reduces hallucination because the model isn't trying to shortcut to a vague answer

And it mimics how we naturally reason through problems — especially in finance


> “This is particularly useful for things like:



ESG signal interpretation

Root-cause analysis

Stress test commentary

Or summarizing multiple drivers behind performance variance”



---

📊 Which one should you use?

> “If you need a polished, well-written answer — use Role + Task + Context + Format. It’s your go-to for writing tasks, summaries, insights, and communication.”



> “If you need thoughtful breakdowns or critical thinking — go for step-by-step prompting. It’s your go-to when you’d otherwise build a bullet framework in your head or on paper.”




---

> “Together, these two techniques cover most use cases you’ll encounter in your day-to-day — whether you're drafting content, extracting insights from reports, or building commentary with internal data.”

🎯 Closing Message

> “AI isn’t something we need to fear or ignore. It’s something we need to understand — so we can use it confidently, creatively, and responsibly.”



> “You don’t have to become an AI expert — you just need to become an expert at using AI to do what you already do best.”



> “Thank you so much for your time — and please feel free to reach out if you'd like to explore more.”

> “And just before we wrap up — there’s a good chance we’ll be doing a Part 2 of this session soon. That one will be a bit more hands-on — diving into live use cases, workflows, and maybe even letting you experiment with AI tools yourselves.”



> “So if today felt like a solid foundation, Part 2 will be about building on it — and applying it directly to the work we do across Asset Management.”



> “We’ll share more details soon, so keep an eye on internal comms — or feel free to drop us a note if you’re interested in being part of that!”


AI makes machines behave smartly.
