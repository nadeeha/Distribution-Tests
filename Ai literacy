Great choice! Here's a clear and logical decision flowchart to help teams choose between server vs. serverless deployment for ML use cases â€” tailored for Vertex AI, Cloud Run, and related GCP tools.

ðŸ§­ Decision Flowchart

START
  |
  |-- Is your workload long-running, stateful, or needs GPU/TPU access?
  |        |
  |       Yes
  |        |--> Use SERVER (GCE VM, GKE, custom training on Vertex AI)
  |
  |-- No
  |        |
  |        |-- Does your use case require scheduled, event-based, or stateless execution?
  |                |
  |               Yes
  |                |--> Use SERVERLESS (Cloud Run, Cloud Functions, Vertex Pipelines)
  |
  |-- Does it require high customization (e.g., custom libraries, drivers)?
  |        |
  |       Yes
  |        |--> Use SERVER (GCE/GKE with custom containers)
  |
  |-- Is it a lightweight REST API for model inference or preprocessing?
  |        |
  |       Yes
  |        |--> Use SERVERLESS (Cloud Run with custom container or Vertex Endpoint)
  |
  |-- Do you need always-on ultra-low latency (<100ms)?
  |        |
  |       Yes
  |        |--> Use SERVER with autoscaling or Vertex Endpoint with dedicated resources
  |
  |-- DEFAULT PATH
  |        |
  |        |--> Use SERVERLESS for simplicity, cost-efficiency, and fast scaling

ðŸ§  Usage Tip

> You can adapt this decision tree per project stage:

Use serverless for prototyping, batch jobs, and internal tools

Use server infra for high-performance prod deployments or specialized workloads
