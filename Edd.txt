Detailed Vertex AI Services (with Official GCP Links)


---

1. Vertex AI Batch Prediction

Purpose: Perform offline prediction on large volumes of data asynchronously.

Use Cases:

Daily churn scoring across customer base

Generating churn risk scores for dashboards or marketing triggers


Ways to Access:

Console UI: Launch Batch Job

CLI:

gcloud ai batch-prediction-jobs create ...

Python SDK:

aiplatform.BatchPredictionJob.create(...)


Output: Predictions stored in GCS bucket (in JSONL or CSV)


---

2. Vertex AI Online Prediction

Purpose: Real-time prediction through REST APIs or client SDKs.

Use Cases:

Predict churn instantly when customer opens the app

Display churn risk to support agents in CRM tools


Ways to Access:

Console UI: Deploy to Endpoint

gcloud CLI:

gcloud ai endpoints deploy-model ...

Python SDK:

endpoint = aiplatform.Endpoint(endpoint_name)
endpoint.predict(instances=[...])

REST API: Send authenticated HTTP POST requests with payload


Output: JSON with predicted labels/probabilities


---

3. Vertex AI Model Monitoring

Purpose: Automatically detect data skew, prediction drift, or feature anomalies in production.

Use Cases:

Alert if customers who previously weren’t at risk are now predicted to churn

Monitor for concept drift over time


Ways to Access:

Console UI: Model Monitoring Setup

Cloud Monitoring Dashboard: Alerting, plotting

Pub/Sub + Logging: Event-based actions on anomaly detection


Output: Logged metrics, alert messages, cloud dashboards


---

4. Vertex AI Model Evaluation

Purpose: Post-training evaluation and comparison of model performance using standard metrics.

Use Cases:

Compare multiple versions of churn models

Track AUC, precision, recall over time


Ways to Access:

Console UI: View evaluation reports for AutoML models

Python SDK + Vertex Experiments:

aiplatform.Experiment.run(...)

TensorBoard: Visualize training/validation metrics


Output: Evaluation reports, confusion matrices, logged metrics

This format works well for Confluence — you can paste this with heading formatting, markdown tables, and working hyperlinks. Let me know if you'd like this exported into:

A Markdown or .docx file for sharing

A PDF summary

A live interactive dashboard version (using Streamlit or Google Looker Studio)


Also, if you want me to plug these services into a Vertex AI Pipeline JSON/YAML template, I can generate that too.
