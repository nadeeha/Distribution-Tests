Great — here’s your updated Leadership section with your role as project lead for the ESG Thematic Portfolio included, keeping the tone natural and well-structured:


---

Leadership

Project Leadership – ESG Thematic Portfolio (GenAI):
I led the end-to-end development of the ESG Thematic Portfolio project, which involved using GenAI and NLP techniques to map company activities to sustainable investment themes. I was responsible for driving the overall solution design, coordinating across teams, building validation models, and presenting the work at internal showcases. The project received strong recognition from senior stakeholders including Galina (IQL).

Intern Management:
I currently manage a new intern in our team. I created a detailed learning and evaluation plan, hold 1:1 sessions twice a week, and run weekly catch-ups involving both interns. I actively guide their work, provide feedback, and help structure their development throughout the internship.

Coaching Circle (Captain):
I served as a captain in the Coaching Circle initiative within Asset Management, where I led peer learning sessions and helped foster knowledge exchange across teams. It was a great opportunity to develop soft leadership and facilitation skills.

AM Mentoring Programme (Mentee):
As a mentee in the AM Mentoring Programme, I received very positive feedback from Nik for my curiosity, consistency, and willingness to learn. This experience gave me valuable insights into leadership from a senior perspective.

Recruitment Involvement:
I’ve been active in recruitment activities, especially in intern onboarding and selection, supporting talent decisions and contributing to team-building efforts.

Perfect — based on your project work and the sessions you facilitated, here’s a well-structured and concise draft for the Data Strategy & Data Culture section. It weaves in your impact from multiple angles while keeping the tone natural and not overly formal:


---

Data Strategy & Data Culture

I’ve contributed to multiple initiatives that support the AM DAO Data Strategy by bringing advanced data science techniques and automation into ESG, regulatory, and operational workflows.

In the ESG Thematic Portfolio (GenAI) project, I led the development of NLP-driven validation models and mapping logic that helped solve the complex problem of linking granular revenue streams to sustainability themes. This work directly supported thematic fund construction and provided deep insights for stakeholders across investment and ESG teams.

Several other projects, such as the Financed Emissions Automation (NZAM) and Policy & ESMA Dashboards, have helped standardize and visualize complex datasets — enabling more reliable and scalable reporting aligned with regulatory requirements.

I’ve also contributed to building data culture through training and knowledge-sharing. I facilitated a Data Science & AI Literacy session for the AM DAO Lunch & Learn and also led a WPB Data Lunch and Learn session on foundational concepts in AI and analytics. These sessions helped demystify data science for broader teams and encouraged uptake of data-driven practices.


Great question. Here's a quick recommendation:

If you want to highlight your external recognition as part of your thought leadership and technical credibility, it fits best in the Summary — as a testament to your innovation and skills being recognized beyond HSBC.

If you want to emphasize how your skills contribute to internal data culture and awareness, and tie it to your AI literacy efforts at HSBC, then it can go in the Data Strategy & Culture section as an example of capability building.


✅ Recommendation: Include in both, but with a different emphasis.


---

🔹 In the Summary (positioned as recognition):

> Additionally, I was selected as a finalist in the Global Prompt Engineering Championship in Dubai, representing HSBC and showcasing innovation in GenAI application on a global stage.




---

🔹 In Data Strategy & Data Culture (positioned as skill leadership):

> I also bring external perspective into our data culture, having been selected as a finalist at the Prompt Engineering Championship in Dubai, which strengthened my hands-on expertise in GenAI—skills I’ve shared internally through AI literacy sessions and mentoring.
