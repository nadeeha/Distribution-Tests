Perfect â€” letâ€™s turn that flow into a task assignment table for your team based on the customer churn use case using Vertex AI (MLOps Level 1).

Please confirm how many team members youâ€™re assigning (and their names/roles if you'd like them included). For now, Iâ€™ll assume 4 members and assign sample roles. You can update this later.
