Got it! Hereâ€™s a single Pandas DataFrame along with five progressively complex questions based on it.


---

Dataset: df_employees

The following dataset contains employee records, including department, salary, experience, and performance ratings.

import pandas as pd

df_employees = pd.DataFrame({
    'EmployeeID': [101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110],
    'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'David', 'Eve', 'Frank', 'Grace', 'Hank', 'Ivy', 'Jack'],
    'Department': ['HR', 'IT', 'IT', 'Sales', 'HR', 'Sales', 'IT', 'Finance', 'Finance', 'Sales'],
    'Salary': [50000, 75000, 80000, 65000, 55000, 72000, 85000, 90000, 88000, 70000],
    'Experience': [5, 8, 10, 4, 6, 7, 12, 9, 10, 3],
    'Performance_Rating': [4.5, 3.8, 4.2, 4.0, 3.5, 4.1, 4.8, 3.9, 4.0, 3.7]
})

Questions:

1. Basic Filtering (Easy)

Question:
Write a query to filter and display employees from the IT department who have more than 8 years of experience.


---

2. Aggregation & Grouping (Basic)

Question:
Compute the average salary for each department and display the result in descending order of average salary.


---

3. Applying a Function (Intermediate)

Question:
Create a new column "Bonus", where:

Employees with a Performance Rating >= 4.5 get a 10% salary bonus.

Employees with a Performance Rating between 4.0 and 4.5 get a 5% bonus.

Others get no bonus.



---

4. Handling Missing Values (Intermediate)

Question:
Suppose the Performance_Rating column has some missing values. Fill missing ratings with the average rating of the respective department.


---

5. Advanced Merging (Intermediate to Advanced)

Question:
Assume you have another dataset df_promotions:

df_promotions = pd.DataFrame({
    'EmployeeID': [101, 103, 105, 108],
    'Promoted': [True, True, False, True]
})

Merge this dataset with df_employees to add the "Promoted" column, ensuring that employees who are not listed in df_promotions have False as the default value.


---

This approach ensures that candidates work with a single DataFrame while still testing their ability to filter, aggregate, apply functions, handle missing values, and merge data.

Would you like me to execute these queries and display the results?
