Here's a clear and structured flow for your presentation slide with step-wise write-ups. This will help narrate the journey from raw FactSet revenue data to thematic tagging and green share calculation using GenAI and taxonomy mapping:


---

Slide Title: From FactSet Revenue Data to Thematic Green Share Tagging


---

Step 1: FactSet Revenue Data (L1 to L6)

Input: Structured revenue segmentation from FactSet at multiple levels (L1 → L6).

Purpose: Provides granular business activity data for ~40,000+ companies.

Example:

L1: Industrials

L6: Waste Recycling Services




---

Step 2: Master File Creation — Inclusion/Exclusion Decision

Objective: Classify L6 revenue items as “Include” or “Exclude” for green tagging.

Basis of Decision:

ESG frameworks (e.g., EU Taxonomy, GFANZ)

Thematic reference documents (e.g., Ellen MacArthur Foundation for Circular Economy)

Existing off-the-shelf mappings from data providers or domain experts.


Themes Considered:

Circular Economy

Climate Adaptation

Climate Mitigation




---

Step 3: Thematic Taxonomy Development

Process:

Build multi-level taxonomies for each theme (e.g., Circular Economy → Material Efficiency → Recycling).

Structure the taxonomy with L1 → L2 → L3 layers (not all branches may have L3).


Source: Human + AI-assisted curation using policy papers, frameworks, and GenAI insights.



---

Step 4: GenAI-Assisted Mapping (Taxonomy → L6 Revenue Items)

Tool: GPT-4 or domain-tuned LLMs

Function: Map each L6 to relevant taxonomy paths for each theme based on semantic understanding.

Outcome: Every L6 (if “included”) is assigned a hierarchical tag (e.g., Circular Economy > Recycling > Industrial Waste).



---

Step 5: Tagging Companies Using FactSet Revenue Data

Action: Match L6s from the master file to each company’s revenue profile.

If L6 is “Include”:

Tag it to the correct theme and hierarchy path.

Use this for green share calculation — % of revenue from green-aligned activities.




---

Step 6: Green Share Calculation

Formula:


\text{Green Share} = \frac{\sum \text{Revenue from Included L6s}}{\sum \text{Total Revenue}}


---

Step 7: Biodiversity Theme (Ongoing Work by Group Ventures & Innovation)

Status: Early-stage — Limited public documentation

Challenge: Lack of structured external frameworks to anchor inclusion/exclusion decisions.

Approach: Collaborative research, possibly domain-expert interviews, and exploratory GenAI applications.

Optional Visual:

Use a flowchart with vertical swimlanes:

1. Data Input (FactSet L1–L6)


2. Filtering (Master File Inclusion/Exclusion)


3. Taxonomy Creation


4. AI Mapping (L6 → Themes)


5. Company Tagging


6. Green Share Output
