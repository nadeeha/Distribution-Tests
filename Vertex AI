Introduction: What Is MLOps and Why Use Vertex AI?


---

What Is MLOps?

MLOps stands for Machine Learning Operations. It refers to the set of tools, practices, and processes used to build, deploy, monitor, and maintain machine learning models in production — reliably and at scale.

Think of MLOps as the DevOps of ML.

Why MLOps Exists:

Without MLOps, machine learning projects often:

Live forever in Jupyter notebooks

Break when deployed due to mismatched environments

Can’t be retrained consistently

Lack visibility into real-world performance


MLOps solves this by introducing: | Capability | Description | |------------|-------------| | Versioning | Track models, code, and data changes | | Automation | Train, test, and deploy with pipelines | | Monitoring | Detect when model performance degrades | | Reproducibility | Ensure you can rebuild any result | | Collaboration | Enable teams to share workflows and artifacts |


---

What Is Vertex AI?

Vertex AI is Google Cloud’s managed MLOps platform. It brings together tools for:

Data prep & feature storage

Model training (AutoML or custom)

Deployment (real-time or batch)

Monitoring and retraining

Pipelines and workflows

Step 1: Explore and Prepare Your Data Using Vertex AI Workbench


---

What is Vertex AI Workbench?

Vertex AI Workbench is Google Cloud’s managed JupyterLab environment, purpose-built for ML developers. Think of it as your cloud-based data science lab — no setup, just code.

Why Use It for Step 1?

Benefit	Description

Pre-installed ML libraries	Comes with pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, etc.
Direct access to GCP resources	Easily access BigQuery, Cloud Storage, and Feature Store
Persistent and shareable	Work is saved in the cloud, great for teams
Customizable environments	Add GPUs or install packages as needed



---

When Should You Use Workbench?

Use Case	Workbench Recommended?	Why?

Initial data exploration and cleaning	✅ Yes	Ideal for visualizing, profiling, and shaping your data
Writing and testing model training code	✅ Yes	Integrated with GCP services and scalable VMs
Automating pipelines or jobs	❌ No	Use Cloud Functions or Vertex Pipelines instead

---

Setting Up Workbench

1. Go to GCP Console

Navigate to: Vertex AI > Workbench > User-Managed Notebooks

Click "New Notebook"

Select a region (e.g., us-central1)

Choose:

Environment: Python (pre-installed with scikit-learn, pandas, etc.)

Machine type: n1-standard-4 or higher



Once launched, click "Open JupyterLab".


---

What to Do in This Step

The first step in any MLOps process is to understand your data and prepare it for downstream processing. This includes:

Task	Why It’s Important

Loading the dataset	Ensures you can access the latest data from GCS, BigQuery, etc.
Profiling the dataset	Helps identify data types, null values, and outliers
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)	Reveals patterns, distributions, and relationships
Cleaning the data	Removes inconsistencies, handles missing values, and ensures type safety
Saving cleaned data	Needed for use with AutoML, Custom Training, and pipelines



---

Typical Code Snippets

1. Load data (CSV from Cloud Storage)

import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("gs://your-bucket-name/data/dataset.csv")
df.head()

2. Check for missing values

df.isnull().sum()

3. Visualize distributions (if numeric)

import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

sns.histplot(df['some_numeric_column'])

4. Check class balance (if classification task)

df['target_column'].value_counts(normalize=True)


---

Tips for Structured Data Use Cases

Use pandas_profiling or ydata-profiling for automatic data profiling reports.

If your dataset has categorical values, encode them early and consistently.

Save a copy of the cleaned dataset before transformation:


df.to_csv("cleaned_data.csv", index=False)
!gsutil cp cleaned_data.csv gs://your-bucket-name/data/cleaned_data.csv


---

Best Practices for Step 1

Best Practice	Why It Matters

Do not skip EDA	Unexpected data issues will break downstream jobs
Use versioned files	Store cleaned datasets under folders like data/v1/
Avoid in-place transformations in notebooks	Keeps workflows reproducible and debuggable
Document assumptions about the data	Essential for auditing and team collaboration
Save intermediate outputs	Enables reuse and checkpoints between steps



---

✅ You’ve Completed Step 1!

At this point, you should have:

Explored and understood your dataset

Cleaned or transformed it as needed

Uploaded the processed data to Cloud Storage


Next up: Step 2 – Train a model using AutoML (for no-code training), or prepare for custom training.

Would you like me to proceed with that general-purpose Step 2 explanation?

‐-----
Perfect! Here's the general-purpose version of Step 2 in the same detailed, beginner-friendly format — focused on using AutoML in Vertex AI to train a model without writing any code. This step is ideal for users with structured (tabular) datasets and minimal ML experience.


---

Step 2: Train a Machine Learning Model Using AutoML


---

What Is AutoML?

AutoML (Automated Machine Learning) allows you to train ML models without writing code. You simply provide:

A dataset (CSV or BigQuery table)

A target column (what you want to predict)


Then Vertex AI will:

Automatically clean and analyze the data

Choose the best algorithm (e.g., XGBoost, neural net)

Train and tune the model

Evaluate performance

Output a ready-to-deploy model



---

When Should You Use AutoML?

✅ Ideal Scenarios:

Use Case	Why AutoML Helps

You’re new to ML	No need to code or tune hyperparameters
You want a quick prototype	Build a model in minutes
You need a production-ready model fast	AutoML outputs deployable models
You’re working with tabular (structured) data	AutoML is very strong for this


⚠️ Not Ideal For:

Use Case	Why Not

You need deep customization	AutoML doesn’t allow model architecture changes
You’re working with unstructured data (e.g., PDFs, audio)	Not all formats are supported yet
You want to control preprocessing and feature engineering	Limited transparency into internal steps



---

What You Need Before Starting

Make sure you’ve completed:

Step 1: You’ve cleaned your dataset and uploaded it to Cloud Storage or BigQuery

File format: CSV or BigQuery table

File is in your project’s region (e.g., us-central1)



---

Step-by-Step: Train Your Model with AutoML

1. Go to Vertex AI > Datasets

Click “Create Dataset”

Choose type: Tabular

Give it a name: customer_churn_dataset, sales_forecast_data, etc.

Choose data source:

Cloud Storage: Point to gs://your-bucket-name/data/your_cleaned_data.csv

BigQuery: Select your table from the UI



2. Configure the Dataset

Set the target column (what you want to predict)

Specify the data type (classification, regression, forecasting)

Let AutoML handle splits (80/10/10 default is fine for most cases)


3. Start Model Training

Click “Train new model”

Name your model (e.g., automl_churn_model)

Choose AutoML (not custom training)

Click “Start Training”


4. Wait for Training to Finish

Training time depends on:

Dataset size

Model type

Resources allocated (AutoML scales up resources as needed)


Usually takes from 20 minutes to a few hours.


---

Once Training Is Complete…

Vertex AI AutoML will show you:

Output	Description

Model summary	Name, creation date, location
Performance metrics	Accuracy, AUC, F1 score, depending on your task
Confusion matrix	For classification: shows misclassifications
Feature importance	Which features contributed most to predictions
Evaluation splits	Performance on training/validation/test sets



---

Best Practices for AutoML

Best Practice	Why It Matters

Balance your dataset	Prevents AutoML from biasing toward dominant classes
Use meaningful feature names	Helps AutoML detect data types correctly
Preview dataset before uploading	Catch column misalignments or nulls early
Don’t include IDs or timestamps as features	These often reduce model generalization
Use AutoML as a baseline	Helps benchmark against custom training results later



---

What Happens Behind the Scenes?

AutoML handles:

Missing value imputation

Feature scaling

Algorithm selection (e.g., tree-based vs. DNN)

Hyperparameter tuning (e.g., learning rate, depth)

Cross-validation

Evaluation metric optimization


You don’t need to manage these — but you can see summary info in the UI.


---

Next Steps After Training

Once AutoML training completes, you can:

Deploy the model to an endpoint for online predictions (Step 5)

Run batch predictions on large datasets (Step 6)

Download the model artifacts if needed (optional)

Compare it with custom-trained models (Step 3)



---

✅ You’ve Completed Step 2!

You now have a fully trained machine learning model with:

Performance metrics

Feature importance scores

One-click deployment option



---

Would you like me to proceed to Step 3: Train a model with your own custom code next — with the same level of detail and best-practice framing?

------------

Absolutely! Let’s simplify Step 3: Custom Training and walk through it in the clearest, most beginner-friendly way — even if this is your first time writing ML code in the cloud.


---

Step 3: Train a Machine Learning Model Using Your Own Code (Custom Training)


---

What Does “Custom Training” Mean?

Custom training means you write your own Python code to train a model, and Vertex AI runs it for you on Google Cloud.

Instead of just uploading a dataset (like with AutoML), you:

Choose how the model is built (e.g., use scikit-learn or TensorFlow)

Write the code yourself

Tell Vertex AI where to find the code and run it on powerful machines



---

Why Would You Use Custom Training?

Situation	Use Custom Training?	Why

You want to learn by coding	✅ Yes	Great way to understand model logic
You want full control over the training process	✅ Yes	You choose the model type, parameters, and saving logic
Your use case is complex or unusual	✅ Yes	Custom training gives you flexibility
You don’t know Python yet	❌ No	Use AutoML instead (Step 2)



---

What You’ll Do in This Step:

1. Write Python code to load your data and train a model


2. Save your code to a folder


3. Upload it to Google Cloud


4. Let Vertex AI run it for you (like pressing “Run” in the cloud)




---

Step-by-Step: Train a Model with Your Own Code


---

Step 1: Write the Code to Train a Model

You’ll write a simple script that:

Loads your dataset

Trains a model

Saves it to a folder


Here’s an example using scikit-learn:

# Save this file as trainer/task.py

import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
import joblib
import os

# Load the dataset from Cloud Storage
df = pd.read_csv("gs://your-bucket-name/data/cleaned_data.csv")

# Separate input features and target
X = df.drop(columns=["target"])  # replace "target" with your column name
y = df["target"]

# Train the model
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X, y)

# Save the model
os.makedirs("model", exist_ok=True)
joblib.dump(model, "model/model.joblib")

What this code does:

Loads your CSV from Cloud Storage

Trains a model using your code

Saves the trained model in a folder called model/



---

Step 2: Package Your Code

You need to tell Vertex AI where your code is and what to run.

1. Create a folder called trainer


2. Put task.py inside it


3. Create an empty file called __init__.py in the same folder


4. Compress the folder:



tar -czf trainer.tar.gz trainer/


---

Step 3: Upload to Google Cloud

Upload the zipped file to your Cloud Storage bucket:

gsutil cp trainer.tar.gz gs://your-bucket-name/code/trainer.tar.gz

Now Vertex AI can find and run your training script.


---

Step 4: Start the Training Job

Run this command from Cloud Shell or your terminal:

gcloud ai custom-jobs create \
  --region=us-central1 \
  --display-name=my-first-custom-job \
  --python-package-uris=gs://your-bucket-name/code/trainer.tar.gz \
  --python-module=trainer.task \
  --machine-type=n1-standard-4

This will:

Start a machine in the cloud

Run your training script

Log everything you print

Save your model files



---

How Do You Know It Worked?

You’ll see logs in the console — if something breaks, the error will show there

If successful, your model will be saved to the model/ folder you created

You can now upload this model to Vertex AI for predictions (in the next step!)



---

Best Practices (Beginner Edition)

Tip	Why It Helps

Test your code locally first	It’s easier to debug on your laptop
Use small sample data when testing	Saves time and cost
Print logs (e.g., “training started…”)	Helps you see what your code is doing
Keep file/folder names simple	Avoid uppercase or spaces in paths
Always save your model to a known folder (like model/)	Vertex AI expects this for easy deployment later



---

✅ You Finished Step 3!

You now know how to:

Write training code

Package and upload it

Run it in Vertex AI


This means you can train any model you want — tree-based, linear regression, deep learning, even PyTorch or TensorFlow.


---

Would you like to move on to Step 4: Upload and register your model so it’s ready for deployment?
