Introduction: What Is MLOps and Why Use Vertex AI?


---

What Is MLOps?

MLOps stands for Machine Learning Operations. It refers to the set of tools, practices, and processes used to build, deploy, monitor, and maintain machine learning models in production — reliably and at scale.

Think of MLOps as the DevOps of ML.

Why MLOps Exists:

Without MLOps, machine learning projects often:

Live forever in Jupyter notebooks

Break when deployed due to mismatched environments

Can’t be retrained consistently

Lack visibility into real-world performance


MLOps solves this by introducing: | Capability | Description | |------------|-------------| | Versioning | Track models, code, and data changes | | Automation | Train, test, and deploy with pipelines | | Monitoring | Detect when model performance degrades | | Reproducibility | Ensure you can rebuild any result | | Collaboration | Enable teams to share workflows and artifacts |


---

What Is Vertex AI?

Vertex AI is Google Cloud’s managed MLOps platform. It brings together tools for:

Data prep & feature storage

Model training (AutoML or custom)

Deployment (real-time or batch)

Monitoring and retraining

Pipelines and workflows


Key Advantages:

Benefit	Why It’s Valuable

All-in-one platform	No need to stitch together 10 tools
Scales from notebooks to pipelines	Works for individual developers and full teams

---

✅ You’re Ready to Begin

Next: Step 1 – Explore and prepare your data using Vertex AI Workbench

Would you like me to continue to Step 2 (AutoML: No-code training) next in this structure?






Perfect — here’s a general-purpose version of Step 1 that applies to any machine learning use case, whether it’s predicting churn, detecting fraud, classifying images, or forecasting sales.


---

Step 1: Explore and Prepare Your Data Using Vertex AI Workbench


---

What is Vertex AI Workbench?

Vertex AI Workbench is Google Cloud’s managed JupyterLab environment, purpose-built for ML developers. Think of it as your cloud-based data science lab — no setup, just code.

Why Use It for Step 1?

Benefit	Description

Pre-installed ML libraries	Comes with pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, etc.
Direct access to GCP resources	Easily access BigQuery, Cloud Storage, and Feature Store
Persistent and shareable	Work is saved in the cloud, great for teams
Customizable environments	Add GPUs or install packages as needed



---

When Should You Use Workbench?

Use Case	Workbench Recommended?	Why?

Initial data exploration and cleaning	✅ Yes	Ideal for visualizing, profiling, and shaping your data
Writing and testing model training code	✅ Yes	Integrated with GCP services and scalable VMs
Automating pipelines or jobs	❌ No	Use Cloud Functions or Vertex Pipelines instead
Lightweight analysis or experimentation	✅ Yes	Faster than local setup or managing VMs yourself



---

Setting Up Workbench

1. Go to GCP Console

Navigate to: Vertex AI > Workbench > User-Managed Notebooks

Click "New Notebook"

Select a region (e.g., us-central1)

Choose:

Environment: Python (pre-installed with scikit-learn, pandas, etc.)

Machine type: n1-standard-4 or higher



Once launched, click "Open JupyterLab".


---

What to Do in This Step

The first step in any MLOps process is to understand your data and prepare it for downstream processing. This includes:

Task	Why It’s Important

Loading the dataset	Ensures you can access the latest data from GCS, BigQuery, etc.
Profiling the dataset	Helps identify data types, null values, and outliers
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)	Reveals patterns, distributions, and relationships
Cleaning the data	Removes inconsistencies, handles missing values, and ensures type safety
Saving cleaned data	Needed for use with AutoML, Custom Training, and pipelines



---

Typical Code Snippets

1. Load data (CSV from Cloud Storage)

import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("gs://your-bucket-name/data/dataset.csv")
df.head()

2. Check for missing values

df.isnull().sum()

3. Visualize distributions (if numeric)

import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

sns.histplot(df['some_numeric_column'])

4. Check class balance (if classification task)

df['target_column'].value_counts(normalize=True)


---

Tips for Structured Data Use Cases

Use pandas_profiling or ydata-profiling for automatic data profiling reports.

If your dataset has categorical values, encode them early and consistently.

Save a copy of the cleaned dataset before transformation:


df.to_csv("cleaned_data.csv", index=False)
!gsutil cp cleaned_data.csv gs://your-bucket-name/data/cleaned_data.csv


---

Best Practices for Step 1

Best Practice	Why It Matters

Do not skip EDA	Unexpected data issues will break downstream jobs
Use versioned files	Store cleaned datasets under folders like data/v1/
Avoid in-place transformations in notebooks	Keeps workflows reproducible and debuggable
Document assumptions about the data	Essential for auditing and team collaboration
Save intermediate outputs	Enables reuse and checkpoints between steps



---

✅ You’ve Completed Step 1!

At this point, you should have:

Explored and understood your dataset

Cleaned or transformed it as needed

Uploaded the processed data to Cloud Storage


Next up: Step 2 – Train a model using AutoML (for no-code training), or prepare for custom training.

Would you like me to proceed with that general-purpose Step 2 explanation?

‐-----
Perfect! Here's the general-purpose version of Step 2 in the same detailed, beginner-friendly format — focused on using AutoML in Vertex AI to train a model without writing any code. This step is ideal for users with structured (tabular) datasets and minimal ML experience.


---

Step 2: Train a Machine Learning Model Using AutoML


---

What Is AutoML?

AutoML (Automated Machine Learning) allows you to train ML models without writing code. You simply provide:

A dataset (CSV or BigQuery table)

A target column (what you want to predict)


Then Vertex AI will:

Automatically clean and analyze the data

Choose the best algorithm (e.g., XGBoost, neural net)

Train and tune the model

Evaluate performance

Output a ready-to-deploy model



---

When Should You Use AutoML?

✅ Ideal Scenarios:

Use Case	Why AutoML Helps

You’re new to ML	No need to code or tune hyperparameters
You want a quick prototype	Build a model in minutes
You need a production-ready model fast	AutoML outputs deployable models
You’re working with tabular (structured) data	AutoML is very strong for this


⚠️ Not Ideal For:

Use Case	Why Not

You need deep customization	AutoML doesn’t allow model architecture changes
You’re working with unstructured data (e.g., PDFs, audio)	Not all formats are supported yet
You want to control preprocessing and feature engineering	Limited transparency into internal steps



---

What You Need Before Starting

Make sure you’ve completed:

Step 1: You’ve cleaned your dataset and uploaded it to Cloud Storage or BigQuery

File format: CSV or BigQuery table

File is in your project’s region (e.g., us-central1)



---

Step-by-Step: Train Your Model with AutoML

1. Go to Vertex AI > Datasets

Click “Create Dataset”

Choose type: Tabular

Give it a name: customer_churn_dataset, sales_forecast_data, etc.

Choose data source:

Cloud Storage: Point to gs://your-bucket-name/data/your_cleaned_data.csv

BigQuery: Select your table from the UI



2. Configure the Dataset

Set the target column (what you want to predict)

Specify the data type (classification, regression, forecasting)

Let AutoML handle splits (80/10/10 default is fine for most cases)


3. Start Model Training

Click “Train new model”

Name your model (e.g., automl_churn_model)

Choose AutoML (not custom training)

Click “Start Training”


4. Wait for Training to Finish

Training time depends on:

Dataset size

Model type

Resources allocated (AutoML scales up resources as needed)


Usually takes from 20 minutes to a few hours.


---

Once Training Is Complete…

Vertex AI AutoML will show you:

Output	Description

Model summary	Name, creation date, location
Performance metrics	Accuracy, AUC, F1 score, depending on your task
Confusion matrix	For classification: shows misclassifications
Feature importance	Which features contributed most to predictions
Evaluation splits	Performance on training/validation/test sets



---

Best Practices for AutoML

Best Practice	Why It Matters

Balance your dataset	Prevents AutoML from biasing toward dominant classes
Use meaningful feature names	Helps AutoML detect data types correctly
Preview dataset before uploading	Catch column misalignments or nulls early
Don’t include IDs or timestamps as features	These often reduce model generalization
Use AutoML as a baseline	Helps benchmark against custom training results later



---

What Happens Behind the Scenes?

AutoML handles:

Missing value imputation

Feature scaling

Algorithm selection (e.g., tree-based vs. DNN)

Hyperparameter tuning (e.g., learning rate, depth)

Cross-validation

Evaluation metric optimization


You don’t need to manage these — but you can see summary info in the UI.


---

Next Steps After Training

Once AutoML training completes, you can:

Deploy the model to an endpoint for online predictions (Step 5)

Run batch predictions on large datasets (Step 6)

Download the model artifacts if needed (optional)

Compare it with custom-trained models (Step 3)



---

✅ You’ve Completed Step 2!

You now have a fully trained machine learning model with:

Performance metrics

Feature importance scores

One-click deployment option



---

Would you like me to proceed to Step 3: Train a model with your own custom code next — with the same level of detail and best-practice framing?

------------

Absolutely! Let’s simplify Step 3: Custom Training and walk through it in the clearest, most beginner-friendly way — even if this is your first time writing ML code in the cloud.


---

Step 3: Train a Machine Learning Model Using Your Own Code (Custom Training)


---

What Does “Custom Training” Mean?

Custom training means you write your own Python code to train a model, and Vertex AI runs it for you on Google Cloud.

Instead of just uploading a dataset (like with AutoML), you:

Choose how the model is built (e.g., use scikit-learn or TensorFlow)

Write the code yourself

Tell Vertex AI where to find the code and run it on powerful machines



---

Why Would You Use Custom Training?

Situation	Use Custom Training?	Why

You want to learn by coding	✅ Yes	Great way to understand model logic
You want full control over the training process	✅ Yes	You choose the model type, parameters, and saving logic
Your use case is complex or unusual	✅ Yes	Custom training gives you flexibility
You don’t know Python yet	❌ No	Use AutoML instead (Step 2)



---

What You’ll Do in This Step:

1. Write Python code to load your data and train a model


2. Save your code to a folder


3. Upload it to Google Cloud


4. Let Vertex AI run it for you (like pressing “Run” in the cloud)




---

Step-by-Step: Train a Model with Your Own Code


---

Step 1: Write the Code to Train a Model

You’ll write a simple script that:

Loads your dataset

Trains a model

Saves it to a folder


Here’s an example using scikit-learn:

# Save this file as trainer/task.py

import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
import joblib
import os

# Load the dataset from Cloud Storage
df = pd.read_csv("gs://your-bucket-name/data/cleaned_data.csv")

# Separate input features and target
X = df.drop(columns=["target"])  # replace "target" with your column name
y = df["target"]

# Train the model
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X, y)

# Save the model
os.makedirs("model", exist_ok=True)
joblib.dump(model, "model/model.joblib")

What this code does:

Loads your CSV from Cloud Storage

Trains a model using your code

Saves the trained model in a folder called model/



---

Step 2: Package Your Code

You need to tell Vertex AI where your code is and what to run.

1. Create a folder called trainer


2. Put task.py inside it


3. Create an empty file called __init__.py in the same folder


4. Compress the folder:



tar -czf trainer.tar.gz trainer/


---

Step 3: Upload to Google Cloud

Upload the zipped file to your Cloud Storage bucket:

gsutil cp trainer.tar.gz gs://your-bucket-name/code/trainer.tar.gz

Now Vertex AI can find and run your training script.


---

Step 4: Start the Training Job

Run this command from Cloud Shell or your terminal:

gcloud ai custom-jobs create \
  --region=us-central1 \
  --display-name=my-first-custom-job \
  --python-package-uris=gs://your-bucket-name/code/trainer.tar.gz \
  --python-module=trainer.task \
  --machine-type=n1-standard-4

This will:

Start a machine in the cloud

Run your training script

Log everything you print

Save your model files



---

How Do You Know It Worked?

You’ll see logs in the console — if something breaks, the error will show there

If successful, your model will be saved to the model/ folder you created

You can now upload this model to Vertex AI for predictions (in the next step!)



---

Best Practices (Beginner Edition)

Tip	Why It Helps

Test your code locally first	It’s easier to debug on your laptop
Use small sample data when testing	Saves time and cost
Print logs (e.g., “training started…”)	Helps you see what your code is doing
Keep file/folder names simple	Avoid uppercase or spaces in paths
Always save your model to a known folder (like model/)	Vertex AI expects this for easy deployment later



---

✅ You Finished Step 3!

You now know how to:

Write training code

Package and upload it

Run it in Vertex AI


This means you can train any model you want — tree-based, linear regression, deep learning, even PyTorch or TensorFlow.


---

Would you like to move on to Step 4: Upload and register your model so it’s ready for deployment?


____<
Great! Let’s move on to Step 4: Upload and Register Your Model — written in the same clear, beginner-friendly format to help you get your trained model ready for deployment, sharing, and monitoring in Vertex AI.


---

Step 4: Upload and Register Your Trained Model in Vertex AI


---

What Does “Registering a Model” Mean?

When you finish training your model (whether with AutoML or your own code), you want to store it in a central place where:

You (or your team) can see what models exist

You can deploy the model to get predictions

You can version and compare different models

You can track metadata like accuracy or training time


In Vertex AI, that place is called the Model Registry.


---

Why Should You Register Models?

Reason	Why It’s Important

Deployment	Only registered models can be deployed to endpoints
Tracking & Versioning	Helps manage v1, v2, etc. — no more guessing
Team collaboration	Makes it easy to share, review, and compare models
Audit & Reproducibility	Know when and how a model was trained



---

When to Register a Model

Model Type	Register It?	Notes

AutoML Model	✅ Automatically registered	
Custom-Trained Model (e.g., scikit-learn)	✅ You upload it manually	
Experimental or broken models	❌ Skip unless you want to track it	



---

Before You Begin

Make sure:

You’ve trained a model using AutoML or custom code (Step 2 or 3)

The trained model is saved in Cloud Storage

For example: gs://your-bucket/models/my_model_v1/


You know the format of your model (e.g., .joblib, .pkl, .h5, TensorFlow SavedModel)



---

Step-by-Step: Upload Your Model to Vertex AI

Step 1: Choose a Serving Container

Vertex AI needs to know how to use your model. This is done using a prebuilt container.

Here are common options: | Model Type | Container URI | |------------|----------------| | scikit-learn | gcr.io/cloud-aiplatform/prediction/sklearn-cpu.1-0 | | XGBoost | gcr.io/cloud-aiplatform/prediction/xgboost-cpu.1-3 | | TensorFlow SavedModel | gcr.io/cloud-aiplatform/prediction/tf2-cpu.2-11 | | PyTorch | gcr.io/cloud-aiplatform/prediction/pytorch-cpu.1-13 |


---

Step 2: Run the Upload Command

gcloud ai models upload \
  --region=us-central1 \
  --display-name="my-model-v1" \
  --artifact-uri=gs://your-bucket-name/models/my_model_v1/ \
  --container-image-uri=gcr.io/cloud-aiplatform/prediction/sklearn-cpu.1-0

What each part means:

--display-name: This is the name you’ll see in the Vertex UI

--artifact-uri: Folder in GCS where your model is stored

--container-image-uri: Tells Vertex how to run the model


Tip: Your artifact folder must include the saved model file (e.g., model.joblib, saved_model.pb, etc.)


---

Step 3: Check Your Model in Vertex AI Console

1. Go to Vertex AI > Models


2. Find your model under the name you used (e.g., my-model-v1)


3. Click it to view:

Metadata

Version history

Evaluation metrics (for AutoML models)

Deployment options





---

Best Practices for Model Registration (Beginner Edition)

Practice	Why It Helps

Use clear version names	e.g., my_model_v1, churn_model_202405
Store models in organized folders	Use models/v1/, models/v2/, etc. in GCS
Include metadata (optional)	Helps with audit and comparisons
Register only complete models	Avoid uploading half-trained or broken models



---

✅ You’ve Completed Step 4!

You now have:

A trained model saved in Cloud Storage

Uploaded it to Vertex AI

Registered it in the Model Registry for future deployment


Coming up: Step 5 – Deploy your model to get real-time predictions via an API.

Shall we continue to Step 5: Online Prediction?

-------


Awesome! Let’s move on to Step 5: Deploy Your Model for Online (Real-Time) Predictions — explained step by step, clearly and simply, even if you’ve never deployed an ML model before.


---

Step 5: Online Prediction – Deploy Your Model as an API


---

What Does Online Prediction Mean?

Online prediction means making real-time predictions using an API. After you deploy your model, you (or an application) can send data to it and instantly get results — like asking, “Will this customer churn?” or “What’s the predicted price?”

This is useful for:

Web or mobile apps

Chatbots

Fraud detection

Any case where fast answers are needed



---

How It Works

1. You deploy your registered model to a Vertex AI endpoint (a web address)


2. You send it a JSON request


3. It returns a prediction — instantly




---

When Should You Use Online Prediction?

Use Case	Use Online Prediction?	Why

You want real-time answers (milliseconds)	✅ Yes	Online prediction is built for low-latency results
You’re building a web app, chatbot, or API	✅ Yes	Plug your app directly into Vertex AI
You need to score huge datasets (e.g., millions of rows)	❌ No	Use batch prediction instead (Step 6)
You want to test your model manually	✅ Yes	Great for quick model experiments too



---

Before You Begin

Make sure:

You’ve completed Step 4 and your model is uploaded to Vertex AI

You know your model ID

You have a Google Cloud region selected (e.g., us-central1)



---

Step-by-Step: Deploy Your Model for Online Prediction


---

Step 1: Create an Endpoint

An endpoint is where your model will live. You can have multiple models on one endpoint (e.g., A/B testing).

gcloud ai endpoints create \
  --region=us-central1 \
  --display-name=my-online-endpoint

Copy the returned endpoint ID from the output.


---

Step 2: Deploy Your Model to the Endpoint

gcloud ai endpoints deploy-model ENDPOINT_ID \
  --region=us-central1 \
  --model=MODEL_ID \
  --display-name=my-model-deployment \
  --machine-type=n1-standard-2

You’ll need to replace:

ENDPOINT_ID with the one from Step 1

MODEL_ID with the model you uploaded in Step 4



---

Step 3: Send a Prediction Request

Prepare your input data in a file named instances.json.

Example (for tabular model):

{
  "instances": [
    [5.1, 3.5, 1.4, 0.2]
  ]
}

Then run:

gcloud ai endpoints predict ENDPOINT_ID \
  --region=us-central1 \
  --json-request=instances.json

You’ll get a response like:

{
  "predictions": [ "setosa" ]
}


---

Best Practices for Online Prediction

Tip	Why It Matters

Start with small inputs first	Easier to test and debug
Secure your endpoint	Use IAM roles or API keys to control access
Enable logging	Track inputs, responses, and latency
Autoscale wisely	Use min-replicas and max-replicas if expecting load changes
Use standard input formats	JSON for tabular data, base64 for images, etc.



---

How Much Does It Cost?

You’re billed for:

The compute resources used (based on machine type and uptime)

Number of predictions made


For testing, use n1-standard-2 (modest cost) and shut down unused endpoints when done.

To undeploy a model:

gcloud ai endpoints undeploy-model ENDPOINT_ID \
  --deployed-model-id=DEPLOYED_MODEL_ID \
  --region=us-central1


---

✅ You’ve Completed Step 5!

You now have:

A trained and registered model

A live API endpoint

The ability to get real-time predictions



---

Would you like to continue to Step 6: Batch Prediction next? That’s great when you want to make predictions on lots of rows of data at once (like 10,000+ entries).


Great! Let’s dive into Step 6: Batch Prediction — designed for when you need to score large volumes of data at once. This is a perfect follow-up to online prediction if you're working with datasets like customer lists, historical transactions, or product catalogs.


---

Step 6: Run Batch Predictions on Large Datasets


---

What Is Batch Prediction?

Batch prediction is when you send a large dataset to your deployed model and get predictions for all records at once — without needing to call the model one row at a time.

Unlike online prediction, batch prediction:

Works asynchronously (results are saved to a file, not returned instantly)

Is meant for high-volume prediction tasks (e.g., 10,000+ records)

Costs less for bulk jobs and is not tied to real-time apps



---

When Should You Use Batch Prediction?

Use Case	Batch Prediction?	Why

Predicting values for a full customer database	✅ Yes	Efficient for large datasets
Running a scheduled prediction every night/week	✅ Yes	Integrates well with pipelines
Your app needs predictions in real time	❌ No	Use online prediction instead (Step 5)
You only have 1 or 2 records	❌ No	Overkill for small inputs



---

Before You Begin

Make sure:

Your model is already uploaded to Vertex AI (from Step 4)

You have access to a GCS input file with data to score

You know your model ID and your region (e.g., us-central1)



---

Step-by-Step: Run a Batch Prediction Job


---

Step 1: Prepare Your Input File

You need a JSON Lines file (one row per line). Example:

{"instance": [6.1, 2.8, 4.7, 1.2]}
{"instance": [5.9, 3.0, 5.1, 1.8]}

Each line must match the input shape your model expects.

Save this file as input.jsonl and upload it:

gsutil cp input.jsonl gs://your-bucket-name/predictions/input.jsonl


---

Step 2: Submit the Batch Job

gcloud ai batch-predictions create \
  --region=us-central1 \
  --model=MODEL_ID \
  --input-path=gs://your-bucket-name/predictions/input.jsonl \
  --output-path=gs://your-bucket-name/predictions/output/ \
  --data-format=jsonl

You’ll need to replace:

MODEL_ID with your model’s ID

GCS paths with your actual bucket and folder names



---

Step 3: Monitor and Download Results

The job runs in the background (asynchronously)

You’ll be notified when it’s done

Results are saved in your specified GCS output folder


Output format example:

{"predictions": ["versicolor"]}
{"predictions": ["virginica"]}


---

Best Practices for Batch Prediction

Practice	Why It Matters

Use versioned folders	Helps trace which model created which predictions
Add IDs to input rows	So you can match predictions back to input records
Use automation	Run with Vertex Pipelines or schedule with Cloud Scheduler
Use jsonl not csv	Batch prediction requires JSON Lines format
Test with 2–3 rows first	Avoid wasting time/cost on large broken files



---

Example Use Cases

Industry	Use Case

Retail	Predict next purchase date for 50,000 customers
Finance	Score loan applications in batches
Manufacturing	Predict maintenance risks across equipment logs
Marketing	Generate churn predictions weekly for all users



---

✅ You’ve Completed Step 6!

You’ve now:

Prepared a batch input file

Submitted it to Vertex AI for scoring

Retrieved predictions for thousands of records



---

Would you like to continue to Step 7: Model Evaluation next? This will help you measure how well your model performs before or after deployment.

&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&

Perfect! Let's go into Step 7: Model Evaluation — a crucial part of any MLOps process. Even the best-trained model is useless if you don't understand how well it's performing and whether you can trust its predictions.


---

Step 7: Evaluate Your Model’s Performance


---

What Is Model Evaluation?

Model evaluation is the process of measuring how well your model performs on unseen (test) data.

It tells you:

How accurate your model is

Whether it’s fair and unbiased

If it’s ready for deployment

What its strengths and weaknesses are (e.g., precision vs. recall)



---

Why Is Evaluation Important?

Reason	Why It Matters

Avoid overconfidence	A model might work great on training data but fail in real-world usage
Reveal bias or class imbalance	One class might dominate predictions
Select the best model	Helps compare different versions
Compliance & audit	Essential in regulated industries (e.g., finance, healthcare)



---

When Do You Evaluate a Model?

Stage	Evaluation Needed?	Notes

After training	✅ Yes	Always validate with a test set
Before deployment	✅ Yes	Avoid putting underperforming models in production
After deployment	✅ Ongoing	Monitor for accuracy drop (Step 8)
During experimentation	✅ Yes	Compare candidate models objectively



---

How to Evaluate Your Model


---

If You Used AutoML:

1. Go to Vertex AI > Models


2. Click your AutoML model


3. Under the “Evaluate” tab, view:

Accuracy / RMSE (based on task type)

Precision, Recall, F1 Score

Confusion matrix (classification only)

ROC Curve and AUC

Feature importance




No code needed — AutoML does it all for you.


---

If You Used Custom Training:

You evaluate your model manually using Python.

Example (classification):

from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix
import pandas as pd
import joblib

# Load test data
df = pd.read_csv("gs://your-bucket-name/data/test.csv")
X_test = df.drop(columns=["target"])
y_test = df["target"]

# Load model
model = joblib.load("model.joblib")

# Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate
print(confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))


---

Common Evaluation Metrics (and What They Mean)

Metric	Task Type	What It Measures

Accuracy	Classification	% of total predictions that were correct
Precision	Classification	How many predicted positives were truly positive
Recall	Classification	How many actual positives were captured
F1 Score	Classification	Balance between precision and recall
AUC / ROC	Classification	Model’s ability to rank positive over negative
MAE / RMSE	Regression	How far off predictions are from actuals



---

What’s a Good Score?

It depends on the use case. Some examples:

Use Case	Key Metric	Target Threshold

Spam Detection	Precision	> 0.95 (avoid false positives)
Disease Diagnosis	Recall	> 0.90 (don’t miss true positives)
Sales Forecasting	RMSE	As low as possible
Churn Prediction	AUC	> 0.80 is usually strong



---

Best Practices for Evaluation

Practice	Why It Helps

Always use a separate test set	Avoid evaluating on the data you trained on
Look beyond accuracy	Use precision, recall, F1, etc. — especially on imbalanced datasets
Visualize results	Confusion matrix, ROC curve, and feature importance reveal insights
Track your metrics	Store results with your model version for auditing
Compare with baseline	Always benchmark against simple models (e.g., “predict most common class”)



---

✅ You’ve Completed Step 7!

You now know how to:

Evaluate a model using AutoML or custom code

Read key metrics

Identify whether your model is ready for deployment



---

Next up: Step 8 – Monitor your model in production to catch errors, drift, or performance issues before they cause real damage. Want to continue?

&&&&&&&&

Great! Let's move into Step 8: Model Monitoring — the part of the MLOps lifecycle that ensures your model stays accurate and reliable after it’s deployed.


---

Step 8: Monitor Your Model in Production


---

What Is Model Monitoring?

Model monitoring is about watching your model’s behavior after deployment — just like you monitor a website or server to make sure it’s healthy.

Specifically, monitoring in Vertex AI can:

Detect if your input data is drifting (changing over time)

Detect if the model’s predictions are skewed

Send alerts when problems are detected

Help trigger retraining pipelines



---

Why Is Monitoring Important?

Risk	Without Monitoring	With Monitoring

Data Drift	Model silently degrades	You get alerts on unexpected changes
Performance Drop	Customers see bad predictions	You can retrain or rollback
Business Impact	Losses go unnoticed	You can act proactively
Audit/Compliance	No visibility into model behavior	Logs and alerts keep you covered


Even the best model at launch may fail if your users or data change over time.


---

When Should You Enable Monitoring?

Scenario	Enable Monitoring?	Why

Production deployment	✅ Always	Prevent silent model failures
Internal testing	❌ Optional	Not mission-critical yet
Temporary experiments	❌ Skip	For fast testing only



---

What Can Vertex AI Monitor?

Monitoring Type	What It Checks

Input Drift	Is the data coming into the model changing?
Prediction Drift	Are the predictions changing unexpectedly?
Label Skew (optional)	Are the ground truth labels different from training?
Latency/Volume	Is the model too slow or over/underused?



---

Step-by-Step: Enable Monitoring in Vertex AI


---

Step 1: Go to Your Endpoint

1. Open Vertex AI > Endpoints


2. Click the endpoint where your model is deployed




---

Step 2: Enable Model Monitoring

1. Click the “Monitoring” tab


2. Click “Enable Monitoring”


3. Choose:



Setting	Description

Drift Detection	Turns on alerts when inputs or predictions change
Training Dataset Source	Upload your training data or use a BigQuery table
Target Dataset for Labels (optional)	Use if you’ll provide actual results later



---

Step 3: Configure Alerts (Optional)

Set thresholds (e.g., alert if drift > 20%)

Send notifications via:

Email

Pub/Sub (for automation)

Slack/webhooks (via Cloud Functions)




---

What You’ll See in Monitoring Dashboard

Charts showing distribution of features over time

Comparisons between live inputs and training data

Anomalies or warnings when drift is detected


Example:

A feature like “country” is 80% US in training, now only 40%

Vertex AI marks this as potential input drift



---

Best Practices for Monitoring

Best Practice	Why It Helps

Enable monitoring for all production endpoints	Avoid silent failures
Monitor most important features	Focus on what impacts predictions
Set realistic thresholds	Not all drift is bad — adjust based on business needs
Log prediction inputs/outputs	Store in BigQuery for troubleshooting
Integrate alerts with your team’s workflow	Email or Slack ensures fast response



---

Advanced Tip: Use Monitoring to Automate Retraining

You can connect model monitoring alerts to:

Cloud Functions (trigger a script)

Cloud Composer / Vertex Pipelines (trigger retraining)

BigQuery (log and analyze drift patterns)


This turns your MLOps process into a closed feedback loop.


---

✅ You’ve Completed Step 8!

You now know how to:

Enable monitoring for deployed models

Detect data or prediction drift

Set up alerts and track model health

General Best Practices

Category	Best Practice	Why It Helps

Data	Clean, validate, and version all input data	Prevents training on incorrect or inconsistent data
Modeling	Start with AutoML to benchmark, then use custom training	Helps balance speed and control
Code	Use clear folder structures and comments in scripts	Makes collaboration and debugging easier
Versioning	Version datasets, models, and experiments	Helps roll back and track progress
Security	Use IAM roles and restrict API access	Protects your data and endpoints
Automation	Use Vertex Pipelines for repeatable workflows	Saves time and avoids manual steps
Monitoring	Always enable drift/accuracy monitoring in production	Helps detect issues before they impact users
Logging	Log inputs, predictions, and errors	Essential for auditing and analysis
Cost Optimization	Use batch prediction for large jobs and small machines for testing	Reduces spend while scaling intelligently



---

Best Practices by Step

Step	Key Tip

Step 1 (Data Prep)	Store all versions of raw and cleaned data in GCS with naming conventions like v1/, v2/
Step 2 (AutoML)	Use AutoML to get a quick baseline before writing custom code
Step 3 (Custom Training)	Start with small sample data to test scripts before scaling jobs
Step 4 (Model Registry)	Include model metadata (accuracy, date, notes) during registration
Step 5 (Online Prediction)	Use n1-standard-2 for light workloads and disable endpoints when not needed
Step 6 (Batch Prediction)	Include record IDs in input files to trace predictions back to original data
Step 7 (Evaluation)	Look beyond accuracy — check confusion matrix, precision/recall
Step 8 (Monitoring)	Start simple (drift only) and gradually expand with label feedback and retraining triggers
